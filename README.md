# Tower-of-Hanoi_1
Python program that solves Tower of Hanoi recursion problem for any number of disks and any number of pegs

Now moving 1 from 3 position to 2 position
2333 move(s) completed
The mass for source location is 11
The mass for intermediate location is 8
The mass for target location is 9
The center of mass from original location is now 1.9285714286 units
The mean center of mass from original location is now 1.4171667381 units
The standard deviation of the Mean Center of Mass is 0.6022869574.
The pegs are now: Peg 1 [2, 3, 6]  Peg 2 [1, 7]  Peg 3 [4, 5]



Now moving 1 from 4 position to 5 position                                    <--------shows what disk is moving and where
5465 move(s) completed                                                          <--------how many moves completed
The mass for source location is 0                                              <--------mass of total disks at source peg after disk move
The mass for intermediate location is 0                                 <--------mass of disks at intermediate peg after disk moved
The mass for target location is 28                                   <--------mass of disks at target peg after disk moved     
The center of mass from original location is now 5.0000000000 units      <-------------original location  = Peg 0
The mean center of mass from original location is now 2.5746438374 units      <-------------original location  = Peg 0
The standard deviation of the Mean Center of Mass is 1.2808254278.
The pegs are now: Peg 3 []  Peg 4 []  Peg 5 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]      <-----------------------Pegs 0, 1 and 2 not shown as they are empty
